  This is an experimental resource meant to be used when exporting data without using the schema mapping feature to BigQuery. It takes as input the desired Schema that the BigQuery table has (the same format as when you would export a schema from a BigQuery table). It will read all columns associated with the specified datastream and make sure they are all the same datatype as specified in the schema. It has quite a few nested loops, so even though effort has been made to optimise it, large schemas may cause this resource to take some time. Patch requests to change columns will only be done if they are different from the desired datatype or if they are not fixed yet.
